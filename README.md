I studied IT for almost 10 years, before I started focusing on internet marketing.
But before I talk about my present, I necessarily have to introduce you to my past; in order to give you the right frame.
 
I always looked at developing as the connection between me and my objectives.
Of course, I started developing because I wanted advantages in online games, I was 10 years old.
 
My first programming language was actually a scripting language for windows.
After I joined a developer’s forum, I started writing more complex codes and helped other people from my community, because I wanted to make my nickname popular.
 
Until few years ago, I was enthusiastic about one particular part of developing.
I was so drawn to cybersecurity, mainly because I wanted to get the passwords of the IT laboratory, in my school.
As I said, IT is only a means, at least for me.
 
In high school, I started  studying web development, especially back-end languages like PHP and MySQL.
And then I studied a lot of JavaScript and CSS, because I wanted to earn some money developing websites with WordPress.
 
I did various internships in different companies when I was at high school, where I could observe the mechanisms behind the world of work, and I realized that I did not want a traditional desk job.
 
My main problem was, I did not have money and my technical skills about web development were useless, if I was couldn’t use them, out of someone else's company.
Nobody will take a boy who is not even of age, seriously.
 
At the same time, I was passionately about studying subjects like literature, psychology and sociology. Moreover, I started writing on a personal blog, that was initially an IT blog.
 
For a period of time I didn’t really study any developing expect in school, all I actually did was apply my existing skills to elementary tasks such as looping statements or arrays.
 
However, I was trying to develop an App or a Website could change my life. I have long dreamt of me in the start-up world, and I have also tried to make that dream come true.
 
So, I built up a team where I invited some problem-solving oriented people to join me, but we were not good enough to compete with the number of professionals, or alleged professionals, that are around IT.
 
I was 16 when we started developing something.
We developed an Android game, which we didn’t publish because it was full of bugs.
Anyway, we didn’t let it destroy our spirit.
 
We decided to create an IT blog about mainly developing and cybersecurity.
We were a nice and equilibrate team, considering our ages and our little experience.
 
I managed all the background tasks that were behind the blog, so I reinforced my WordPress skills and learned about SEO.
This is also how I developed interest in marketing.
 
Of course, I had no idea about marketing at that time.
We didn’t monetize our work and obviously, we started slowing down in our publications, until we completely stopped.
 
At 18, I founded my first IT company, when my teammates were changing their objectives and visions. One of my colleague and friend stayed with me; so, we decided to get into the project as mutual friends.
 
I realized that what we were doing was not really sustainable and scalable, because I had little money and my team was not skilled and motivated enough.
 
After 3 months, I made the decision to stop everything and accept the amount of time and money spent. Only to realize few months later that my resources had not been wasted at all.
I learned a truckload of things thanks to this bad experience.
 
First of all, I established that becoming rich with IT does not require a lot of purely technical skills, but skills like management, relationship and marketing.
Yes, one of the objectives in my life is to get a certain amount of riches, and I don't have any trouble saying it.
 
Secondly, I realized that my passion for psychology and sociology could help, if I used it correctly with my technical skills.
 
Some weeks after day 0, I tried some cheap strategies to get a single customer, that was not one of my personal or unserious customers, like friends of friends or opportunistic people.
 
I obviously started with cold, calling local activities, and immediately I recognized how useful it could be, understanding matters likes psychology and sociology.
 
Subsequently, the end of my company; I understood marketing also includes rules of those academic disciplines. So, I started studying public and business communication at the university to better understand which way to take.
 
I actually did not apply myself in the university like I would have done, because I was looking for better ways to get potential customers.
After thousands of hours of videos and blogs, I finally got some results.
 
I got my first online customer and I optimized his websites to make them faster and SEO oriented. Then I collaborated with his team to create a new really customized website for his company.
 
This was just the first serious job of a long series.
My mindset started improving, and the number of customers grew together with that.
 
Until I decided to limit the IT jobs, only with few customers at the same time.
This allows me to provide high quality jobs to my selected customer and keep studying developing and marketing
 
I actually don’t feel like a developer or a marketer.
I loved looking at myself, as an entrepreneur; since I was younger and it seems as if this is not going to change.
